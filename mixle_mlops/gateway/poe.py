"""Token-level Product-of-Experts fusion — combine several models' next-token distributions geometrically.

The math (exact) is `mixle.ops.product_of_experts`: a fused distribution `p(t) ∝ ∏_k p_k(t)^{w_k}` over the shared
token support. ``fuse_next_token`` builds it from each model's top-logprobs; ``poe_rerank`` is the sequence-level
form (pick the candidate with the highest weighted sum of per-model log-probabilities — PoE in log space).

HONEST BOUNDARY: true *per-token PoE-decoded generation* needs incremental decode control — feed the fused
distribution back, sample, repeat — over a SHARED vocabulary. The OpenAI-compatible chat API exposes neither
forced-token continuation nor (across heterogeneous tokenizers) an aligned vocabulary, so full token-by-token PoE
decoding requires a logit-level serving integration (a vLLM/llama.cpp custom sampler + DeePEn-style vocab
projection). What's built here is the exact fusion primitive + the sequence-level reranker — the parts the API
actually supports — not a faked in-decoder masker."""
